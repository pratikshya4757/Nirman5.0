Asian Paints is a listed company and is primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of \\ndecorative and industrial paints. According to its Annual Report for FY 2018–19, it is the \\nthird largest paint company in Asia and the largest in India. It has eight manufacturing \\nplants for decorative paints and two for industrial paints in India. \\n \\n4. Starting January 2019, JSW Paints approached several dealers in Bengaluru, Hubli, \\nKochi, Kozhikode, Hyderabad and Chennai and explained the unique nature of their \\npaints, proposed pricing, benefits to dealers in terms of tinting and delivering paints, etc. \\nJSW Paints stated that it offered dealers better margins and incentives than those offered \\nby its competitors. JSW Paints had a positive response from several dealers/retailers. In \\norder to confirm their interest, JSW Paints asked for cheque of Rs. 1 lakh as advance \\nfrom the dealers to be set off against their launch orders. Based on receipt of the cheque, \\nsuch dealers were invited to the Retailers Launch Meet organised by JSW Paints , where \\nit provided them with an overview of their strategy and how they would work together to \\npromote the JSW brand, place orders, receive stocks, billing, inventory, etc. \\n \\n5. After three years of investing in building up the business and spending sums of money \\non developing its brand, JSW Paints launched its decorative paints in May 2019 in \\nBengaluru and Hubli. The launch was covered by several mainstream media. \\nSubsequently, JSW Paints launched its products in Kerala (Kochi and Kozhikode) in \\nJune 2019, followed by Telangana (Hyderabad) and Tamil Nadu (Chennai) in August \\n2019. \\n \\n6. JSW Paints  alleged that , immediately after the launch of its decorative paints, Asian \\nPaints began pressurising dealers who had agreed to stock and display decorative paints \\nmanufactured by JSW Paints . Asian Paints targeted dealers/distributors/retailers \\npartnering with JSW Paints , directing them to stop dealing with JSW Paints, stopping \\nsupplies to these dealers, dropping service levels by delaying supplies and deliveries, \\nasking dealers to remove display s of JSW Paints products from their retail shelves and \\ndealer signboards, thre atening dealers by not allowing them discretionary discounts, not \\ninviting them for trips and loyalty schemes, etc. Asian Paints did this through its sale s \\npersonnel in the relevant regions.

It has been alleged that JSW Paints has been denied access to dealers, which is essential  \\nfor operating in the relevant market, due to punitive action taken by Asian Paints against \\nthe dealers. JSW Paints is stated to have faced problems in the states of Karnataka, Tamil \\nNadu and Telangana. JSW Paints had planned to launch its products in more states and \\ncities in South and West India, such as Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, etc., \\nand also introduce its products to dealers in upcountry towns, supplying from its \\nwarehouses in larger towns. JSW Paints , however, believed that it would be denied \\naccess to dealers even in these states and would face the same resistance in other regions \\ndue to coercive action taken by Asian Paints against the dealers.  \\n \\nInstances in the State of Karnataka  \\n8. Several dealers were appointed by JSW Paints  in the State of Karnataka . Although JSW \\nPaints provided necessary signage and other promotional material such as danglers, \\nposters, etc., the dealers were compelled to remove all signage and other promotional \\nmaterial from cons picuous locations in their premises to the back of the premises or to \\ntheir godowns at the behest of Asian Paints . For fear of losing the dealership of Asian \\nPaints, certain dealers decided to discontinue purchase JSW Paint’s products. An \\ninstance of a dealer has been cited, whereby the dealer requested Asian Paints to unblock \\nits dealership ID and resume supply  of its products. Further, it was alleged that a written \\nassurance was given by this dealer to Asian Paints that he would never purchase and sell  \\nany of JSW Paint’s products.  \\n \\n9. In addition to abovementioned acts against the dealers, Asian Paints allegedly also \\npressurised enterprises that provided infrastructure facilities like warehouses to JSW \\nPaints to not stock products of JSW Paints. In an instance cited, the enterprise that \\nprovided warehouse facility rescinded the contract with JSW Paints on account of Asian \\nPaints requiring it to choose between Asian Paints and JSW Paints  for a business \\nrelationship. It has been alleged that the sheer vol ume of business given by Asian Paints \\nand the potential loss in revenue resulted in the enterprise succumbing to the pressure of'),\n",

The rescission of contract with JSW Paints led to delay in the launch of \\nJSW’s products in Hubli, which resulted in loss of revenue, reputation and credibility.  \\n \\nInstances in the State of Tamil Nadu \\n \\n10. In Chennai, although several dealers agreed to partner with JSW Paints before the \\nlaunch, many of them were directed by Asian Paints to not attend JSW Paints ’ Retailers \\nLaunch Meet. After the launch of products, at least 12 dealers did not place any orders \\nwith JSW Paints fearing reprisal from Asian Paints . Dealers were allegedly prevented \\nfrom undertaking any business with JSW Paints. It was alleged that if th e dealers did not \\ncomply with the demands of Asian Paints, the dealers would face punitive action from \\nAsian Paints. \\n \\n11. Allegedly, Asian Paints had taken punitive action against a dealer in the past on account \\nof its decision to stock and sell paints manufac tured by Nippon Paint India Private \\nLimited ( ‘Nippon’). Asian Paints is stated to have resumed its supplies only after the \\ndealer agreed to cease business relations with Nippon. In the year 2015 –16, Nippon had \\nattempted to enter the decorative paints market in Chennai. However, Asian Paints took \\nsimilar action against the dealers who entered into commercial relationship with Nippon.  \\n \\nInstances in the State of Telangana  \\n12. Several dealers were appoi nted by JSW Paints  in the State of Telangana . Due to \\nharassment at the hand of Asian Paints, the dealers were compelled to remove danglers, \\nboards and products relating to JSW Paints from conspicuous locations on their \\npremises. Several instances of harass ment faced by the dealers in Hyderabad were cited. \\nThe dealers refrained from dealing with JSW Paints due to the pressure exerted by Asian \\nPaints.  \\n \\n13. Asian Paints was alleged to be hindering the entry of JSW Paints by virtue of its \\ndominance in the market f or the manufacture and sale of decorative paints by the \\norganised sector in India, in contravention of provisions of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act. It \\nwas alleged that t he conduct of Asian Paints is aimed at preventing JSW Paints from \\nestablishing its presence in the said market. By taking action, Asian Paints had not only \\ndenied market access to a competing entity but also restricted the freedom of contract to'),\n",

Such practices not only led to an effective and efficient competitor being driven \\nout of a market or restricted from entering a market, but also limited consumer s’ choice. \\nIt was stated that the decorative paints market is dependent upon the direct \\ndistributorship model. Without access to dealers, which is an essential feature of this \\nbusiness, there is no scope for new or existing entity in this market to survive. Asian \\nPaint’s conduct allegedly led to the denial of access to necessary distribution channels in \\nthe relevant market , which prevented JSW Paints from entering the relevant market in \\ncontravention of the provisions of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act. Asian Paints deliberately \\nand maliciously sought to pressurise dealers , who are mainly small and medium scale \\nenterprises, from stocking and selling JSW Paint’s products. \\n \\n14. Based on instances highlighted in the States of Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, it \\nwas alleged that the conduct of Asian Paints is a case of enforcing an exclusive supply \\nagreement in terms of Explanation (b) to Section 3(4) of the Act and refusal to deal as \\nprovided in Ex planation (d) to Section 3(4) of the Act.  Allegedly, t he said conduct \\ncaused appreciable adverse effect on competition by creating barriers to entry, driving \\nexisting competitors out of market and foreclosure of competition by hindering entry of \\nJSW Paint s into the market. All the instances of abusive conduct are tantamount to \\nperpetuating anti-competitive agreements as Asian Paints enjoys a dominant position in \\nthe relevant market. Such agreements cause appreciable adverse effect on competition \\nand are in contravention of provisions of Section 3(4) read with Section 3(1) of the Act.  \\n \\n15. In light of the averments made in the instant information, JSW Paints prayed to the \\nCommission to pass an order under Section 26(1) of the Act , directing the Director \\nGeneral (‘DG’) to cause an investigation to be made into the matter; direct Asian Paints \\nto cease and desist  from carrying on any of the alleged anti -competitive activities; pass \\nan order under Section 27 of the Act penali sing Asian Paints; and pass any other ord ers \\nthat the Commission may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case. \\n \\nPrima-facie consideration of the Commission in Case No.36 of 2019 \\n16.

It was observed that , without access to the dealers, there is no scope \\nfor a new or existing entity to survive in the market , as the dealers are the interface of \\nbusiness with customers and help the products of manufacturers reach them. In the facts \\nof the present case, the Commission noted that the alleged conduct of Asian Paints of \\nthreatening and pressurising dealers as highlighted by JSW Paints prima facie brought \\nout that Asian Paints attempted to prevent JSW Paints in establishing a presence in the \\nrelevant market , and this conduct prima facie appeared to be tantamount to abuse of \\ndominant position by Asian Paints, wherein Asian Paints denied access to ne cessary \\ndistribution channels in the relevant market and limited the availability of alternate \\nproducts in the relevant market for consumers , thereby reducing the competition in the \\nmarket in contravention of provisions of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act. The C ommission \\nalso observed that , as a result of the conduct of Asian Paints, the final consumers may \\nalso be deprived of the choice to purchase different kinds of paints at competitive prices. \\nThe Commission was of the view that evidence provided by JSW Paint s was prima facie \\nsufficient to indicate that Asian Paints denied access to the distribution channels in the \\nrelevant market to JSW Paints by threatening and coercing such dealers through various \\nmeans. In view of foregoing, Asian Paints prima facie appeared to be in contravention of \\nprovisions of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act.  \\n \\n17. With respect to alleged contravention of Section 3(4) of the Act, the Commission \\nobserved that the restraints imposed by Asian Paints appeared to be in the nature of \\nexclusive supply agreement and refusal to deal. Such restrictions prima facie appeared to \\nlimit the dealers from procuring same/similar products from other sources at a cheaper \\nprice. The Commission observed that t his restriction on the choice of dealers c ould limit \\nbenefits that consumers may have received otherwise. The Commission noted that the \\nalleged restrictions on dealers not to deal with JSW Paints or any other company \\nmanufacturing paints could create barriers for suppliers of paints who compete with \\nthese suppliers , besides not allowing the benefit of better prices to consumers. It was \\nobserved that a stipulation that appeared to create barriers to entry and restricted the \\nchoice of consumers is likely to result in appreciable adverse effect on competi tion, \\nresulting in higher prices for consumers. Thus, the Commission was prima facie satisfied \\nthat the imposition of said restraints amounted to contravention of Section 3(1) of the'),\n",

The Information was filed by Sri Balaji Traders ( ‘Balaji Traders ’/‘Informant No.2’) \\nagainst Asian Paints alleging contravention of provisions of Sections 3(4) and 4 of the \\nAct. It was alleged that , soon after Balaji Traders  began deal ing with JSW Paints in \\nFebruary 2021, its Critical Retailer status, given by Asian Paints since 2010, was \\nrevoked in March 2021 without prior notice. Resultantly, the tinting software installed on \\nBalaji Traders ’ computer by Asian Paints , which enables a retailer to make critical \\nshades, was also removed. It was alleged that removal of the said software has prevented \\nBalaji Traders from placing new orders o f the Critical Retailer products o f Asian Paints \\nand from tinting the leftover material to create shades exclusively offered to a crit ical \\nretailer. It was stated that the leftover material with Balaji Traders worth Rs. 3,50,000/- \\nhad become dead stock that c ould not be sold to any customer. It was also alleged that \\nAsian Paints told Balaji Traders that its Critical Retailer status would be restored after a \\nthree-month review period if it signs a letter that it had no problem with Asian Paints. It \\nwas alleged that the sales supervisor of Asian Paints attempted to coerce Balaji Traders \\ninto signing a certificate stating that Asian Paints h ad never taken any coercive steps \\nagainst Balaji Traders because of its dealings with the competing brand ,i.e., JSW Paints. \\nThe above discussed conduct of Asian Paints was alleged to be in contravention of \\nprovisions of Sections 4 and 3(4) of the Act.  Balaji Traders also relied upon the earlier \\ndecision of the Commission in Case No. 36 of 2019 (JSW Paints Private Limited Against \\nAsian Paints Limited), wherein the Commission prima facie found Asian Paints to be in \\ncontravention of provisions of Section s 4 and 3(4) of the Act and directed the DG to \\ninvestigate into the conduct of Asian Paints. Balaji Traders requested the Commission to \\nclub the said information with Case No. 36 of 2019 in terms of proviso to Section 26(1) \\nof the Act and order an investigat ion into the alleged anti-competitive conduct of Asian \\nPaints.'),\n",

On 20.07.2021, the Commission considered the aforementioned information and was of \\nthe opinion that the subject matter of the instant Information was substantially the same \\nas that contained in the Information in Case No. 36 of 2019, which was under \\ninvestigation by the DG. Thus, in the exercise of powers conferred under proviso to \\nSection 26(1) of the Act read with Regulation 27 of the Competition Commission of \\nIndia (General) Regulations, 2009, the Commission decided to club the matter with Case \\nNo. 36 of 2019. Accordingly, the DG was directed to investigate the said matter \\nalongwith Case No. 36 of 2019 and submit a consolidated investigation report in the \\nmatters. \\n \\nFindings of Investigation \\n \\n20. The DG, pursuant to the directions of the Commission, investigated both the matters and, \\nafter seeking due extensions of time, submitted a consolidated Investigation Report on \\n17.12.2021, both in confidential and non -confidential versions. For the sake of brevity, \\nthe evidence relied upon by the DG would be referred to and dealt with appropria tely \\nwhile analysing the matter on merits.A brief of the findings of investigation by the DG is \\nas under: \\n \\na. Relevant market: The DG stated that “decorative paints ” and “industrial paints ” \\nconstitute separate markets. The DG also stated that there is no unorganised sector in \\nthe market , and far -reaching policy moves such as implementation of GST  and \\ndemonetisation ha ve significantly altered the landscape of the paints industry and \\nvirtually eliminated the unorganised sector. As per the DG, due to implementation of \\nnew regulations ,i.e., Lead Regulation 2016, all players were compelled to organise. \\nThe DG observed that , though the paints industry still comprises unbranded paints \\nmanufacturing units, which merit exclusion from the relevant market und er \\nassessment, the policy moves compelled the DG to relook at the relevant market, as \\nthe face of organised players has seen significant transformation after November \\n2017. The investigation relied upon a study undertaken by Toxic Links and \\nInternational Pollutants Elimination Network published in 2018 in relation to brand'),\n",

The said study revealed that 58% of the respondents \\npreferred to buy specific brands as they are mostly durable, cost effective and good \\nquality. It was found that 95% of the respondents use or prefer leading brands. Only \\n5% of the respondents use local brands and most of these consumers belong to low -\\nincome groups and preferred these paints because of their low cost. Accordingly, the \\nDG concluded that the relevant product market in the present case has been \\ndelineated as “market for manufacturing and sale of decorative paints by the \\norganised sector”. With respect to the relevant geographic market, the DG noted that \\nthe condition of competition for the dec orative paints industry is homogeneous \\nthroughout the country , and  therefore, the whole nation is the relevant geographic \\nmarket. Accordingly, the relevant market for the purpose of assessment of market \\npower in the present matter has been delineated by th e DG as “market for \\nmanufacturing and sale of decorative paints by the organised sector in India”. \\n \\nb. Assessment of dominant position of Asian Paints: \\ni. Market share of enterprise : The DG noted that , as per the data published by \\nCMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy), Asian Paints has the highest \\nmarket share ,of 38.99% in 2019–20, with Berger Paints as the second-placed \\nmanufacturer, at 12.98%. Historically, the market share of Asian Paints is \\naround three times its closest competitor in the relevant market. The DG also \\nnoted that the market share of an enterprise is an indicator of market power, \\nbut the determination of dominant position merely on the basis of market \\nshare of the enterprise could be misleading.  \\n \\nii. Size, resources of enterprise and competing firms: Asian Paints has been able \\nto maintain its market position as a market leader even though its market \\nshare reduced. Based on the revenue  and the number of depots/warehouses, \\nthe DG observed that Asian Paints is so deeply rooted with dealers across the \\ncountry that its nearest competitor is less than half of its network. The \\nrevenue from the operations of Asian Paints is three times that of its nearest \\ncompetitor. Notwithstanding the above, JSW Paints is part of a well-\\nestablished conglomerate and has an advantage of well-established network \\nin allied sectors, which can be leveraged for gaining a strong foothold in the'),\n",

Thus, the  DG observed that Asian Paints may have the \\nlargest market share , but the economic advantages of other players –existing \\nand prospective– pose strong competitive threats to the market leader. \\n \\niii. Barriers to entry and expansion : The d ecorative paints industry does not \\nhave any barriers to entry for a new player. The DG observed that  the \\nrelevant market facilitates free entry of firm as evidenced by at least five new \\nentrants in the last 20 years, and the recent expansion initiatives undertaken \\nby both the exist ing players as well as prospective entrants in the relevant \\nmarket. Further, there are four major paint producers who have added \\nsignificant capacity or are in the process of adding additional capacity to \\ntheir operations. Thus, there are no barriers of expansion. \\n \\niv. Vertical integration and financial strength : Unlike new competitor JSW \\nPaints and prospective entrant Grasim Industries (Ultratech Paints), Asian \\nPaints does not enjoy the advantage of vertical integration, as none of its \\ngroup companies operat e in upstream/downstream activities and /or allied \\nindustries. Further, a few existing competitors – Kansai Nerolac, Jotun Paints \\nand Nippon Paints  – represent MNCs in India with significant economic \\nstrength in terms of financial power , making the domesti c decorative paints \\nmarket all the more competitive.  \\n \\nv. Countervailing buyer power : The DG noted that the countervailing buyer \\npower of the dealers is strong enough to withstand any kind of unreasonable \\npressure of the manufacturer. The dealers are a direct interface for decorative \\npaints with the consumer and play an instrumental role in effecting the sales \\nfor paint companies. The DG observed that the dealers engage in the sale of \\nmore than one decorative paint brand ; generally, a dealer handles five to six \\npaint companies . Therefore, the paint company is more dependent on the \\ndealers due to their strong buyer power, and not vice-versa. \\n \\nvi. Conclusion on dominant position of Asian Paints : The DG concluded that \\nAsian Paints enjoys a position of dominance in the relevant market on the \\nbasis of its highest market share for substantial period of time.

Abuse of dominant position under Section 4 of the Act: \\ni. No denial of market access : The DG stated in its report that Asian Paints, \\nthe market leader, was able to make a net addition of 401 and 816 dealers \\nduring 2019–20 and 2020–21 (total of 1217) against the new entrant JSW \\nPaints’ net addition of 722 and 869 dealers during the same period ( total \\n1591). Therefore, the fact and figures of net addition of dealers during the \\nrelevant period contradict s the allegation of denial of market access to \\nJSW Paints, as it was able to add more new dealers to its network than the \\nmarket leader, Asian Paints. The DG found that even the allegation of \\ndealers of being under pressure from Asian Paints not to deal with JSW \\nPaints is not substantiated, as the percentage of dealers who discontinued \\ntheir relationship with Asian Paints is much higher for Asian Paints in \\nterms of new additions, and vice-versa for JSW Paints. The DG concluded \\nthat JSW Paints was able to appoint more dealers compared to even the \\nmarket leader, Asian Paints. Therefore, the al legation regarding denial of \\nmarket access pertaining to the distribution network is not supported by \\nthe facts. This belief gains further credence with the disparity in the \\nnumber of dealers claimed to be engaging with both Asian Paints (654) \\nand JSW Paints (1378). The allegation further st ood depreciated in view \\nof the fact that only 15 dealers , out of 1378 allegedly common dealers \\n(taking the higher estimate), came forward and levelled allegations against \\nAsian Paints. Further, none of the 15 dealers  submitted enough evidence \\nto substantiate their allegations, so that contravention could be legally \\ndemonstrated. \\n \\nii. Denial of access to infrastructural facilities: With regard to the allegation \\non denial of market access by Asian Paints, by restricting access to the \\ninfrastructural facilities to JSW Paints, the DG noted that the reason for \\ntermination of the lease agreement between Mrs. Sajida Kalebudde and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'source': 'Data\\\\order1662638477.pdf', 'total_pages': 45, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content='Case Nos. 36 of 2019 & 17 of 2021                                            Page 13 of 45 \\nJSW Paints seem ed to be a dispute regarding the extension of Carrying \\nand Forwarding Agent and logistic s services between the parties to the \\nagreement.  The DG, however, noted that there was a possibility of Asian \\nPaints influencing the submissions of Mrs. Kalebudde. The investigation \\nrevealed that there was no evidence on record to  indicate that the lease \\nagreement entered into by JSW Paints for its warehouse at Hubli was \\nterminated at the instance of alleged pressure by Asian Paints . Therefore, \\nthe allegation regarding denial of market access to infrastructural facilities \\nis also not supported by evidence on record. \\n \\nVertical restraints under Section 3(4) of the Act: \\ni. The DG observed that, prima facie, Asian Paint’s conduct may seem anti -\\ncompetitive from a plain reading of some of the allegations/submissions \\nof the dealers, but these allegations lose their sheen when read in \\nconsonance with specific responses to each allegation submitted by Asian \\nPaints and when the same was confronted byit following the principles of \\nnatural justice. \\n \\nii. All the allegations made by the dealers appear to be \\nmisconceived/motivated, as Asian Paints was able to adduce substantive \\nevidence to prove that the act of reduction in credit of a dealer was not \\ndue to the alleged business association of a d ealer with a competitor but \\ntheir own mutual business relationship. However, in case of a few dealers, \\nsuch as Siva Sankara Agencies, Sagar Hardware and Paints and Nayak \\nTraders, though reduction might be justified on merits, substantial \\nreduction in credi t limit may not be commensurate with the default in \\npayment and/or going into overdue (OD)by the dealers. But Asian Paints \\nfollowed a similar trend even for resumption/increase in credit limit of the \\ndealers, when they improved their off-take. \\n \\n \\n \\niii. As regards the alleged stoppage of supplies to such dealers who started \\nbusiness with the competitor brand, Asian Paints was able to justify its \\nspecific action in almost all cases. Asian Paints’ conduct did not show any \\nabnormal trends in terms of orders ser viced for any specific dealer during'),\n",

It may be a mere coincidence that the dealers were reprimanded for their \\ndefault by Asian Paints around the time they had started doing business \\nwith JSW Paints. Asian Paints ’ action against the dealers, however, \\nseemed to be independent of their engagement with other paint \\ncompanies. Asian Paints substantiated its contentions by adducing \\nevidence in the form of the details of 500 dealers in the relevant \\ngeographies, whose credit limit was increased/decreased as a matter of \\nroutine, dependent purely on the performance of the concerned dealer. \\n \\n \\nv. The DG could not unearth credible evidence from any dealer which could \\nprove Asian Paints ’ attempt to pressurise them to return JSW materials  \\nand/or tinting machines. \\n \\nvi. Two dealers (out of 15) , who had complained of the anti -competitive \\nconduct of Asian Paints, also placed on record an affidavit affirming fair \\nand transparent conduct by Asian Paints as a business partner, which \\nfurther erodes the credibility of complainant dealers.  Additional evidence  \\nsubmitted by JSW Paints towards the end of investigation by JSW Paints \\nrelating to Neelam Hardware Paints and Hardware showed that dealers \\nwere being manipulated by paint companies to fabricate \\nallegations/evidence.  \\n \\n \\nvii. In view of the foregoing, the  allegations against Asian Paints imposing \\nrestraints in the nature of exclusive supply agreement and refusal to deal \\nunder Section 3(4)(b) and 3(4)(d) of the Act c ould not  be substantiated \\nand was untenable. \\n \\nd. Findings on Case No.17 of 202 1: The downgrade of the dealer Balaji Traders from \\nCritical Retailer to Colour World by Asian Paints was fully justified and ha d no \\nrelationship with the starting of business with the competing brand. The inference has \\nbeen drawn on the basis of the following facts:'),\n",

The change in retailing tier was affected on 28.04.2021 as against the alleged \\nclaim of February 2021 by the dealer. \\nii. The d ealer was consistently reducing off -take from Asian Paints, which \\nreduced to less than half over a period of 10 month s, from October 2020 to \\nJuly 2021. \\niii. Updating of tinting software was undertaken by Asian Paints on a regular \\nbasis. \\n \\niv. Retailing tier of the said dealer was restored in June 2021 along with seven \\nother dealers after a review exercise undertaken by Asian Paints on the basis \\nof sales, expected sales, customer outreach and other relevant factors.  \\nv. Retailing tier of the said d ealer was changed from Ezy Critical Retailer Status \\nto Critical Retailer in 2018 –19, when the dealer had not even started business \\nwith any competing brand, which corroborate d with the fact that Asian Paints’ \\nconduct with respect to its business partners is independent of their association \\nwith competitors.  \\n \\ne. Investigation regarding digital/electronic evidence in the form of audio/video \\nrecordings: \\ni. With regard to audio/video evidence submitted by the Informants/collected \\nduring the investigation from the dealers, the investigation revealed that, in the \\nconversations, dealers deliberately tried to elicit a response from the official of \\nAsian Paints to convey that Asian Paint s’ actions were carried out in \\nretaliation of their newly formed relationship with JSW Paints. \\n \\nii. The DG concluded that the digital evidence on record may not be considered \\nin isolation but in the context/background to the conversation made by the \\npersons concerned in view of the legal precedents. Further, the recorded \\nconversation m ay be interpreted in congruence with documentary evidence \\nalready on record, which seems to validate the conduct of Asian Paints. \\nNonetheless, minor indiscretions were observed on part of Asian Paints \\nofficials during the recorded conversation, but the sam e was insufficient to \\nestablish anti-competitive conduct on part of Asian Paints.'),\n",

It has \\nalso been stated that  the space between organised and unorganised players has blu rred \\nand there is no separate unorganised sector.  All players selling decorative paints in the \\nmarket impose competitive constraints on each other and are subject to the same rules \\nand regulations. Accordingly, the relevant market be defined as “ market for manufacture \\nand sale of decorative paints in India ”. Asian Paints cannot operate independently or \\naffect competitors or consumers or the relevant market in its favour. The fact that \\nintegration and expansion initiatives have been successfully launched by other \\ncompetitors, as identified by the investigation, undermines the allegation of Asian Paints’ \\ndominance in such a competitive industry.  With respect to the allegation of dominant \\nposition enjoyed by Asian Paints, it has been stated that , though the investigation has \\nnoted that holding the market leader as dominant on the basis of market share may not be \\ncorrect, it has considered Asian Paints dominant solely for the purpose of assessing its \\nalleged conduct. The investigation has not made any conclusion of dominance of Asian \\nPaints. It has merely presumed Asian Paints ’ dominance to proceed further to review its \\nalleged abusive conduct.  It has been sta ted that, given that there is no abusive conduct, \\nthe Commission may leave the question of dominance open. It has been stated that Asian \\nPaints faces competition from new entrants , with evidence of at least five new players in \\nlast 20 years, faces expansion efforts by existing players, lacks the advantages of vertical \\nintegration possessed by JSW Paints and Grasim and faces significant constraints from \\ndealers who exercise significant countervailing buyer power. Accordingly, Asian Paints \\nis not dominant by any measure in any given market.  Asian Paints has concurred with \\nthe findings of the DG in relation to abuse of dominant position to state that Asian Paints \\nhas not abused any hypothetical dominant position. Asian Paints has not abused its \\nalleged dominant position with respect to denying JSW Paints access to the dealership \\nnetwork or infrastructural facilit ies. It has been stated that JSW Paints has been able to \\nadd more dealers than Asian Paints in 2019 –20 and 2020 –21, which refutes the \\nallegation of denial of access.

It has been stated that t he DG has \\nalso concurred with the Commission after conducting an analysis of the negligible \\nimpact of the Lead Regulation 2016 on the brand image of paint manufacturers and \\nconsumer preferences. JSW Paints has agreed with the DG’s conclusion that consumer \\npreference is still with leading brands and the unorganised sector, even after the \\nimplementation of Lead Regulation 2016, which is not posing any competitive \\nconstraints on such manufacturers. The Lead Regulation suffered from poor \\nimplementation and it c ould not be relied upon to conclude that the unorganised sector \\nhas been virtually eliminated.  In this regard, JSW Paints has relied upon a study titled \\n“How Safe is your Paint—Compliance of Lead in Paint Regulations in India” published \\nin 2020 by Toxic Link (Toxic Link Study) to suggest that there are serious concerns on \\nthe implementation of the Lead Regulation, 2016 , and minimal progress has been made \\nby Small and Medium E nterprises in eradicating hazardous heavy metal from their \\npaints. Therefore, owing to the negligible impact of the Lead Regulation 2016 on the \\nmarket practices, there continues to be a substantial difference in the brand image, \\npricing and quality of pain ts and there remains no reason to alter the definition of the \\nrelevant market to include the unorganised sector.'),\n",

As regards the dominant position enjoyed by Asian Paints in the relevant market, JSW \\nPaints has stated that the DG has relied on an erroneous and misleading analysis of \\ncertain factors under Section 19(4) of the Act to raise doubts regarding Asian Paints ’ \\ndominance. Any reliance on events/announcements post the prima facie order, such as \\nthe announcement by Grasim regarding its entry in the rele vant market and the listing of \\nIndigo Paints in 2021, bear no relevance to the analysis of the dominant position of \\nAsian Paints in FY 2019 –20, which was the period of key abuse. As per JSW Paints, a \\nproper analysis of the factors under Section 19(4) of th e Act demonstrates that Asian \\nPaints is dominant in the relevant market . Asian Paints ’ market share being consistently \\nhigher, by almost three times , than the second largest player in the market (Berger), is a \\nclear indication of the dominance of Asian Paints. It has been further stated that Asian \\nPaints is a company with large resources and turnover. Asian Paints ’ increase in revenue \\nhas been nearly  three times that of its nearest competitor. Superior financial strength, \\nlarge dealer network and increase in the number of tinting machines clearly indicate \\nAsian Paints ’ market strength. Asian Paints increased its active distribution/dealer \\nnetwork from 53,000 in 2017 –18 to 70,000 in FY 2020 –21. Asian Paints also increased \\nthe number of its tinting machines supplied to dealers from 35,000 in 2017–18 to 46,000 \\nin 2019–20. Asian Paints has a strong brand name as well as a vast distribution network , \\nwhich pro vides it an advantage over its competitors. Given that Asian Paints is \\nconsidered a must -stock brand for paint dealers, dealers are dependent on it for their \\nsuccess. It has been stated that the DG has taken a time period of 20 years to judge ease \\nof entry in the market in order to create an impression that there are no entry barriers in \\nthe market. In the last 10 years, there has been no significant change in market conditions \\nand no major new players have entered the market. It has been submitted that paint \\ndealers are typically small ‘mom and pop’ shops and do not have any countervailing \\npower to pose any constraints on a dominant player like Asian Paints. The dealers are \\ncompletely dependent on Asian Paints not only to procure paints but also the ince ntives \\noffered by the company. It has been stated that Asian Paints is the price leader in the \\nmarket and has a strong brand value amongst consumers , which places it in a position of \\nstrength and enable s it to act independently of competitive forces , and t hus, it has a \\ndominant position in the relevant market.'),\n",

As regards the analysis of abuse of dominant position by Asian Paints, it has been \\nsubmitted that the DG’s analysis is superficial and incomplete as the DG has erroneously \\nlimited the analysis of abuse to Asian Paints’ actions against JSW Paints and has ignored \\nthe evidence submitted by third -party dealers. The DG has failed to consider that there \\nwere the following two facets to Asian Paints ’ abuse: Asian Paints attempted to deny \\nmarket access to a new entrant (exclusionary abuse) and took punitive actions against \\ndealers who were dealing with JSW Paints (exploitative abuse).  It has been further stated \\nthat DG has also failed to investigate how Asian Paints uses its discretionary and \\ncomplex incentive schemes to arm-twist the dealers and disincentivises them to deal with \\ncertain competitors, such as JSW Paints. The dealer incentive schemes offered by Asian \\nPaints are quite complex and, as a result, most dealers are at Asian Paints ’ mercy on \\ntarget a chievement and their entitlement of various incentives. If a dealer does not \\ncomply with the directions of Asian Paints (e.g., not to deal with a particular player), \\nAsian Paints threatens such dealers by saying that Asian Paints would not support such \\ndealers. The DG also failed to analyse and consider the discretionary and loyalty -\\ninducing nature of various other incentives/schemes offered by Asian Paints , which are \\nused to arm -twist dealers, resulting in denial of access to the distribution network for \\nnew entrants like JSW Paints.  It has been submitted that Asian Paints has attempted to \\ndeny access to the distribution network to JSW Paints , and the extent of the denial is \\nirrelevant to establish a contravention , as even a partial denial of access can result in \\nviolation of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act.  It has been further stated that the DG has solely \\nrelied on an incorrect and misleading metric of additions of dealers and wrongly \\nconcluded that JSW Paints had a sm ooth entry into the market owing to higher net \\naddition of dealers. The DG has erroneously compared the growth pattern of a dominant \\ncompany which has the largest distribution network in the country with a new entrant \\nwhich was at the stage of starting to build its distribution network from scratch . It has \\nbeen submitted that the discrepancy in the number of common dealers submitted by JSW \\nPaints and Asian Paints was clear evidence that a large number of dealers were not able \\nto deal with JSW Paints openly.  The DG has failed to probe into the discrepancy in the \\nnumber of common dealers and has failed to form any opinion or conduct any analysis \\non this critical point, which seems to be consistent with the DG’s attempt to shield Asian \\nPaints. It has been stated that a total of 148 dealers discontinued dealing with JSW Paints \\nin FY 2019–20, out of which 137 were common dealers (92.56%). A total of 250 dealers'),\n",

It has been submitted that the DG has failed to investigate this key \\nallegation of returning the tinting machines of JSW Paints and failed to record any \\nreasons for the same. The only observation from the DG in this regard comes under the \\nanalysis of Asia n Paints’ action under Section 3(4), where it has been observed that the \\n15 dealers have not been able to submit any evidence to show that Asian Paints forced \\nthem to return the tinting machine,  whereas JSW Paints had submitted details of 107 \\ndealers who discontinued dealing with JSW Paints despite investing in tinting machines.  \\nThe lack of depth in the DG’s investigation is also evident from the fact that the DG \\nplaced reliance on Mrs. Kalebudde’s submission that she was willing to lease the \\nproperty to JS W Paints as on the date of her response (23 .12.2020) if the CFA and \\nlogistics business is allocated to her firm.  It has been stated that her offer does not affect \\nor offset any monetary/reputational loss which JSW Paints had to face in April –\\nMay2019. The fact that Asian Paints attempted to disrupt the operations of a new entrant, \\nJSW Paints , by manipulating a warehouse owner to rescind her agreement with JSW \\nPaints was enough to return a finding against Asian Paints. \\n \\n33. As regards the findings of the DG in relation to vertical restraints, JSW Paints has \\nsubmitted that the DG analysis of Asian Paints ’ conduct under Section 3(4) of the Act is \\nincomplete, as it has failed to analyse the conduct of the dealers who were succes sfully \\ncoerced by Asian Paints not to deal with JSW Paints.  It has been submitted that the DG \\nReport has been limited to the investigation done in relation to only 15 dealers, most of \\nwhom did not succumb to the dik tats of Asian Paints and continued to dea l with JSW \\nPaints. JSW Paints had submitted a list of 107 dealers who invested in JSW Paints tinting \\nmachines and had to completely stop dealing with JSW Paints. JSW Paints also \\nsubmitted a list of 13 dealers who purchased JSW Paints tinting machines but w ere not \\nable to use them. JSW Paints had also submitted detailed reasons as to why these dealers \\ndid not install the tinting machines. The fact that such a larger number of dealers refused \\nto even come forward to call out Asian Paints ’ abusive practices demonstrates the fear of \\na giant like Asian Paints among dealers. Paint dealers are small ‘mom and pop’ stores , \\nand any coercive action by Asian Paints impinges on the daily livelihood of such dealers. \\nIt has been submitted that the multiple instances of Asian Paints’ coercive actions and \\nimposition of restrictions highlighted also amount to the contravention of Section 3(4)(b)'),\n",

For example, imposing unfair restrictions on dealers to \\nnot to deal with JSW Paints and punishing such dealers by stopping \\nsupplies/withdrawing support/withholding incentives, if they continue to procure \\nsupplies from JSW Paints , also results in an arrangement covered under Section 3(4)(b) \\nand Section 3(4)(d) of the Act , and the restrictions imposed by Asian Paints have caused \\nAAEC in the relevant market under Section 19(3) of the Act as the business practices of \\nAsian Paints have created barriers for a new entrant  and Asian Paints’ actions are also \\naimed at driving competitors out of the market. Nippon , in its submissions before the \\nDG, stated some instances where certain dealers doing business with market leaders \\nrefused to deal/supply with Nippon decorative paints. For the sake of brevity, the \\nsuggestions/objections/submissions of JSW Paints would be dealt with by the \\nCommission appropriately while analysing the case on merits.   \\n \\nSubmissions/objections/submissions of Balaji Traders \\n \\n34. Balaji Traders has made submissions similar to JSW Paints. It has been stated that the \\nDG’s analysis is flawed and there is enough evidence in terms of consistently high \\nmarket shares of Asian Paints in the relevant market and its huge dealership network to \\nconclude that Asian Paints holds a dominant position in t he relevant market. It has been \\nsubmitted that the DG made no attempt to reach out to the Informant post the prima-facie \\norder to understand the nature of allegations and evidence. The DG did not inform the \\nInformant about the justification given by Asian Paints to defend itself or check with the \\nInformant if the justifications were true. Only one email was sent in November 2021 \\nstating that the Informant may provide further evidence within three days . It has been \\nsubmitted that, with a view to close the investigation in a hurried manner, the DG merely \\nforwarded the allegations made by the Informant to Asian Paints and accepted the \\njustification offered by Asian Paints without reaching out to the Informant.  It has been \\nsubmitted that t he sudden revocation of the C ritical Retailer status without prior \\nintimation is indicative of the fact that the actual reason for changing the retailing tier \\nwas to punish the Informant for dealing with JSW Paints , and the argument relating to \\nthe ineligibility was an afterth ought which was used to cover up Asian Paints’ actions \\nafter the Informant decided to take action against Asian Paints.

The Commission has carefully perused the Investigation Report and evidence in support \\nthereof submitted by the DG, objections/suggestions filed by the parties, the oral \\nsubmissions made by the parties on 31.05.2022, the synopsis of arguments subsequently \\nsubmitted and other material available on record.

In order to assess the conduct of the Asian Paints under the provisions of Section 4 of the \\nAct, a relevant market needs to be delineated first , followed by an assessment of Asian \\nPaints’ position in the said relevant market and then the alleged abusive conduct. \\n \\n37. Relevant market  consists of relevant product market  and relevant geographic market . \\nThe relevant product market as defined under Section 2 (t) of the Act means “ a market \\ncomprising of all those products or services which are regarded as interchangeable or \\nsubstitutable by the consumer, by reason of characteristics of the products or services, \\ntheir prices and intended use”. \\n \\n38.

The relevant geographic market, on the other hand, defines the contours with reg ard to \\nterritory within which the conditions of competition for supply of goods or provision of \\nservices are distinctly homogenous and can be distinguished from the conditions \\nprevailing in the neighbouring areas. \\n \\n40. In the present case, JSW Paints is aggrie ved by the alleged abusive conduct of Asian \\nPaints, whereby it has been denied access to distribution channels in the decorative \\npaints segment which, in turn, prevented JSW Paints from entering the market.  \\n \\n41. The Commission notes that JSW Paints has agreed with the delineation of relevant \\nmarket by the DG. On the other hand, Asian Paints has stated that all players selling \\ndecorative paints impose competitive constraints on each other regardless of the \\norganised or unorganised sector and are subje ct to the same rules and regulations and \\nthus, defined the relevant market as “ market for manufacture and sale of decorative \\npaints in India”. \\n \\n42. The Commission notes that decorative paints and industrial paints constitute separate \\nsegments as there is a cle ar distinction between the two segments based on \\ncharacteristics, intended use and price. Further, players in the unorganised sector do not \\nappear to pose competitive constraint s upon players in the organised sector due to \\nvarious reasons such as brand image, difference in pricing, quality, etc. The Commission \\nis in agreement  with the DG’s finding that consumer preference is still with leading \\nbrands, and the unorganised sector, even after the implementation of Lead Regulation \\n2016, does not pos e any competitive constraints on manufacturers  in the organised \\nsector. The Commission also notes that the DG, despite stating that there is no organised \\nsector and the distinction between organised sector and unorganised sector has blurred , \\nfinally concluded that the relevant product market in the present case has been delineated \\nas “market for manufacturing and sale of decorative paints by the organised sector ”. As \\nregards the relevant geographic market, the Commission is of the view that conditions of \\ncompetition in the paint sector are homogeneous across India. Thus, the relevant \\ngeographic market could be defined as “ whole of India ”.

Having delineated the relevant market, the  Commission now proceeds to examine \\nwhether Asian Paints holds a position of dominance, as alleged, in the sai d relevant \\nmarket. \\n \\n44. The Commission notes that t he Act defines the term “dominant position ” under \\nexplanation (a) to Section 4 as “ a position of strength enjoyed by an enterprise, in the \\nrelevant market, in India, which enables it to (a) operate independent ly of competitive \\nforces prevailing in the relevant market; or (b) affect its competitors or consumers or the \\nrelevant market in its favour”. \\n \\n45. The Commission notes that the underlying principle for assessing the dominance of an \\nenterprise is linked to the market power enjoyed by the enterprise. An enterprise is \\nregarded as dominant if it enjoys/possesses a position of strength in the relevant market, \\nwhich enables it to operate independently of competitive forces prevailing in the relevant \\nmarket or affect its competitors or consumers or the relevant market in its favour. \\n \\n46. JSW Paints and Balaji Traders have stated that Asian Paints enjoys a dominant position \\nin the relevant market, as has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. On the other \\nhand, Asian P aints has submitted that it has no ability to affect its competitors or \\nconsumers or relevant market in its favour and cannot be said to enjoy a position of \\ndominance under the provisions of the Act. Based on an analysis of factors under Section \\n19(4) of the Act, Asian Paints has stated that it does not have a dominant position in the \\nrelevant market delineated by it . It has been stated that Asian Paints faces competition \\nfrom new entrants, with evidence of entry of at least five players in the last 20 years, lack \\nof advantages of vertical integration available to it like to Grasim and JSW, constraints \\nexercised by its dealers, etc.   \\n \\n47.

As per the said report, Asian Paints  is India’s \\nlargest paint company, commanding over 40% of the overall domestic paint industry \\nand 55% in dom estic decorative paint industry as against second largest paints \\ncompany, Berger Paints,  which commands 12% market share of the overall paint \\nindustry and over 20% market share of the domes tic decorative paints segment.  \\nThus, the competitors based on their market shares do not appear to have posed any \\ncompetitive constraints on Asian Paints during these periods.  \\n \\nb. Size, resources and economic power of the enterprise : The Informant has stated that \\nAsian Paints has the largest installed capacity in the market.  In FY2019–20, the total \\ninstalled capacity in the organi sed paint sector was 3.5 million kilo litres per annum \\n(KLPA), out of which Asian Paints had an installed capacity of 1.8 million KLPA, \\ni.e., more than half of the total capacity of the sector. It has also been stated that t he \\ninstalled capacity of Asian Paints was twice that of its closest competitor, Berger. \\nAsian Paints is a company with large resources , and its turn-over and its revenues \\nfrom the paints segment increased from Rs. 10,300 crores to Rs. 16,189 crores over \\na period of five years ( FY 2014 to FY 2019), whereas the revenues of its closest \\ncompetitor, Berger, increased from Rs. 3,735 crores to Rs.5,515 crores. Asian \\nPaints’ increase in revenue has been nearly three times that of Berger’s during the'),\n",

JSW Paints has further stated that \\nsuperior financial strength, large dealer network and increase in number of tinting \\nmachines indicate Asian Paints’ market strength. It has been stated that Asian Paints \\nincreased its active distribution/dealer network fr om 53,000 dealers in FY 2017–18 \\nto 70,000 in FY 2020–21. In comparison, Berger only has over 25,000 dealers across \\nIndia. Further, Asian Paints also increased the number of its tinting machines from \\n35,000 in 2017 –18 to 46,000 in 2019 –20. Asian Paints has a strong brand name as \\nwell as a vast distribution network which provides it an advantage over its \\ncompetitors. The Commission notes that Asian Paints has the largest revenue of Rs. \\n17,194.1 crores and largest number of dealers (more than 70,000)  for FY 2019–20 \\ncompared to its competitors. Berger, its closest competitor, has a revenue of Rs. \\n6,366 crores, which is about1/3rd the revenue of Asian Paints for FY 2019 –20. If the \\nresources in terms of number of dealers are compared, Berger has around 25 ,000 \\ndealers, which is again about 1/3rdthe size of the dealers with Asian Paints.

As regards the exit of players from the market, JSW Paints has stated \\nthat Sherwin Williams , which is the second largest paints company in the world  by \\nrevenue, had exited the decorative paints business in the year 2013 by selling its \\nbusiness to Berger Paints. Further, it has been stated that the top four players, i.e., \\nAsian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac and Akzo Nobel, have always held 80% \\nof the market share in the organised decorative paints market segment. It has been \\nfurther stated that manufacturing and distribution of paints is a cost -intensive \\nbusiness, which includes initial cost of setting up business, marketing costs , etc. As \\nper J SW Paints, other entry barriers include development of an extensive \\ndistribution network through long -term relationship with dealers, ability to set up \\ntinting machines, etc. Asian Paints, on the other hand , has relied upon the entry of \\nGrasim, with a capital outlay of Rs.5 ,000 crores in the decorative paints segment, to \\nshow that the market is competitive. Asian Paints has also relied upon the expansion \\nplans of younger competitors like Indigo and Kamdhenu and players like Akzo \\nNobel to show th at there are no barriers to entry or expansion. In this regard, the \\nCommission notes that, for the last 10 years, as per the CMIE data, the paint market \\nhas seen the presence of four major players, which are Asian Paints, Berger Paints \\nIndia Limited, Kansa i Nerolac Paints Limited and Akzo Nobel India Limited , with \\nthe entry of players like Jotun, Indigo , etc. The Commission notes that players like \\nJotun and Indigo appear to be small players , and their entry in the recent past do not \\nseem to be of such magnitude and scope so as to pose sufficient competitive \\nconstraint upon a large player like Asian Paints. This is corroborated by the market \\nshares of these players, which have only been in the range of 0 –2% for the period \\nbetween 2011–12 and 2019–20 (as is evident from the table referred above) . This \\nshows that these players have not been able to garner sufficient market share in the \\npaints market in the last 10 years. The Commission further notes that reliance upon \\nentry of Grasim by Asian Paints, which was revealed in its Annual Report of 2020 –\\n21, is also misplaced. The Commission observes that t his has no bearing on the \\nassessment of dominance of Asian Paints in the year for which allegations of abuse \\nwere made , i.e., FY 2019 –20. Further, t he evidence o f an international player, \\nSherwin Williams, exiting the market, sustainability in the paint industry  may be an \\nissue.'),\n",

Countervailing buying power: The Commission notes that, as stated by Asian Paints \\nin its response, does at times alter the credit limit of the dealer based on parameters , \\nsuch as performance, demand in the market, market reputation , etc. It seems that \\nAsian Paints exercises great influence over the decision -making of its dealers. \\nMoreover, paint dealers are generally small ‘mom and pop’ s tores and do not appear \\nto have any countervailing buyer p ower and seem to be totally dependent on it not \\njust for procurement of paints but also for the incentives. It appears that the dealer \\ncannot even determine the inventory it can stock. The Commissio n also notes the \\nsubmission of JSW Paints that decorative paints industry works on a ‘direct \\ndistribution model’, where a paints manufacturer directly supplies to dealers without \\nappointing any distributors or wholesalers. In such a distribution model involving \\ndistributors/wholesalers, JSW Paints further submitted that dependency of dealers on \\na paints company and the influence of a paints company is much greater compared \\nto a distribution model involving distributors/wholesalers. Thus, this brings out that \\ndealers do not possess any countervailing buyer power and are at the mercy of Asian \\nPaints and not vice-versa, as claimed by Asian Paints. Accordingly, the Commission \\ndoes not find any merit in the submissions of Asian Paints that dealers have \\nsignificant countervailing buyer power.  \\n \\n49. In view of the foregoing , the Commission concludes that Asian Paints appears to be in a \\ndominant position in the relevant market of “ market for manufacture and sale of \\ndecorative paints by the organised sector in India”. \\n \\n50. Once the relevant market has been delineated and the position of dominance of the Asian \\nPaints therein established, the Commission now examines whether Asian Paints sought \\nto exclude JSW Paints by threatening and coercing dealers in the paint industry , thereby \\nacting in contravention of provisions of Section 4 of the Act. \\n \\n51. With respect to contravention of provisions of Section 4 of the Act, the Commission \\nnotes that the DG has carried out a two-prong analysis, one in relation to alleged denial \\nof access to distribution channels and the second with respect to alleged denial o f \\ninfrastructural facilities to JSW Paints . The DG noted that Asian Paints, the market'),\n",

Therefore, the fact and figures of the net \\naddition of dealers during the relevant period contradict the allegation of denial of \\nmarket access to JSW Paints, as they were able to add more new dealers to thei r network \\nthan the market leader, Asian Paints . The DG concluded that JSW Paints had been able \\nto appoint more dealers compared to even the market leader, Asian Paints. Therefore, the \\nallegation regarding denial of market access pertaining to the distribut ion network is not \\nsupported by the facts. As per the DG, t his belief gains further credence given the \\nsignificant number of dealers engaging with both companies, (654 according to Asian \\nPaints and 1378 according to JSW Paints) , as on 31.03.2021 . As per the DG, only 15 \\ndealers came forward and levelled allegations against Asian Paints out of 1378 allegedly \\ncommon dealers (taking the higher estimate). Further, none of the 15 dealers submitted \\nevidence sufficient enough to substantiate their allegati ons, so that contravention could \\nbe demonstrated. With regard to the allegation of denial of market access by Asian Paints \\nby restricting access to infrastructural facilities to JSW Paints, the DG noted that the \\nreason for termination of the lease agreemen t between Mrs. Sajida Kalebudde and JSW \\nPaints seemed to be a dispute regarding extension of relationship of Carrying and \\nForwarding Agent and logistics services between the parties to the agreement. The \\ninvestigation revealed that there was no evidence on  record to indicate that the lease \\nagreement entered into by JSW Paints for the warehouse at Hubli was terminated at the \\ninstance of pressure exerted by Asian Paints. Therefore, the allegation regarding denial \\nof market access to infrastructural facilities was not supported by the evidence on record. \\n \\n52. Asian Paints, in its suggestions/objections to the Investigation Report , has concurred \\nwith the findings of the DG  that it has not abused a ny hypothetical dominant position. \\nThere is no foreclosure or limit on the access to the dealershi p network of JSW Paints. \\nAsian Paints has not denied JSW Paints access to the dealership network, which is not \\nexclusive to Asian Paints in any case. As per the data submitted by JSW Paints, the fact \\nthat JSW Paints has  approximately 86.6% of its dealer network common with Asian \\nPaints proves beyond doubt that Asian Paints has not obstructed dealers from dealing \\nwith JSW Paints , and JSW Paints has no response on this data point. Asian Paints has \\nfurther submitted that th ere was no limit on the access to infrastructural facilities.'),\n",

JSW Paints  has disagreed with the analysis undertaken by the DG in this regard.  The \\nInformant has stated that the DG has failed to consider the following two facets to Asian \\nPaints’ abuse: Asian Paints attempted to deny market access to a new entrant \\n(exclusionary abuse) and punitive actions against dealers who were dealing with JSW \\nPaints (exploitative abuse). It has been stated that there is no analysis of exploitative \\nabuse vis-à-vis dealers, specifically under Section 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(d) of the Act. The \\nanalysis has been carried out in relation to Section 3(4) of the Act. Even if no violation \\nof Section 3(4) is assumed, no conclusion on violation of Section 4 of the Act by Asian \\nPaints can be reached, as there was no analysis by the DG in this respect. The allegations \\nof exploitative abuse raised by the dealers, i.e., unfair credit blocks, unfair supply \\ndisruptions, loyalty-inducing incentive schemes  and forcing them to sign affidavits are  \\nmore relevant to the analysis under Section 4 of the Act than a Section 3(4) analysis. \\nNotwithstanding any violation of Section 3(4) of the Act, these allegations certainly \\nresult in violation of Section 4 of the Act. \\n \\n54. JSW Paints has further stated that the DG has failed to take into account certain critical \\nemails sent by the dealers , demonstrating the attempts by Asian Paints to coerce them \\ninto signing affidavits in Asian Paints ’ favour. Instead of asking the dealers why they \\ngave such affidavits to As ian Paints contrary to their complaints, the DG decided to use \\nsuch affidavits to raise doubt s about the credibility of the complainant dealers. Reliance \\nhas been placed upon  an email written by Karavali  Enterprises dated 09.04.2021, \\nwherein it has been st ated that the dealer was forced to sign a letter that it did not face \\nany problem with Asian Paints. As per JSW Paints, the DG did not investigate this issue. \\nThere were other dealers who had submitted such emails against Asian Paints , and it was \\ncritical for the DG to have analysed and examined the veracity of such affidavits \\nsubmitted by Asian Paints on behalf of the dealers.  JSW Paints has further submitted \\nthat the investigation by the DG did not focus on the key period of abuse, i.e., May 2019 \\nto Janu ary 2020 . It has been submitted that , after the prima-facie order, Asian Paints \\nmade its abusive practices more discreet to ensure that no concrete evidence was left \\nbehind. It has been submitted that Asian Paints also discontinued its RVM scheme,'),\n",

It is surprising that the DG did not find violation of provisions \\nof Section 4 of the Act despite holding that RVM seems to be anti -competitive in nature \\nto promote exclusivity.  \\n \\n55. It has been further stated that incentive schemes for the dealers offered by Asian Paints \\nare quite complex and, as a result, most dealers are at Asian Paints ’ mercy for the \\ninformation on target achievement and their entitl ement of various incentives. If a dealer \\ndoes not comply with the directions of Asian Paints ( e.g., not to deal with a particular \\nplayer), Asian Paints threatens such dealers by saying that it would not support them. \\nThe DG also failed to analyse and consider the discretionary and loyalty-inducing nature \\nof various other incentives/schemes offered by Asian Paints which are used to arm -twist \\ndealers, resulting in denial of access to the distribution network for new entrants like \\nJSW Paints. It has been further stated that the DG has solely relied on an incorrect and \\nmisleading metric of net additions of dealers and has wrongly concluded that JSW Paints \\nhad a smooth entry into the market owing to higher net addition of dealers. It has been \\nstated that a total of 148 dealers discontinued dealing with JSW Paints in FY 2019 –20, \\nout of which 137 were common dealers ( 92.56%). A total of 250 dealers discontinued \\ndealing with JSW Paints in FY 2020 –21, out of which 201 were common dealers \\n(80.4%).This data was ignored by the DG. It has been further submitted that the extent of \\ndenial is irrelevant , and denial in any manner would also amount to contravention of \\nprovisions of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act. It has been submitted that the DG has failed to \\ninvestigate this  key allegation of returning of the tinting machines of JSW Paints by \\ndealers and has failed to record any reasons for the same  as well as dealers who had \\nexpressed interest in dealing with JSW Paints by depositing an initial confirmation \\namount of Rs. 1 lakh but never purchased paints from JSW Paints . The DG has also \\nfailed to analyse the detailed evidence provided by JSW Paints in terms of dealers who \\nwere being disincentivised by Asian Paints from dealing with JSW Paints. With respect \\nto denial of acces s to infrastructural facilities, the DG failed to conduct an investigation \\ninto the extent of influence of Asian Paints exercised over the decision of Kalebudde \\nfamily to deny access to JSW Paints and ignored the detailed evidence submitted by JSW \\nPaints in this regard.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'source': 'Data\\\\order1662638477.pdf', 'total_pages': 45, 'page': 35, 'page_label': '36'}, page_content='Case Nos. 36 of 2019 & 17 of 2021                                            Page 36 of 45 \\n56. Having regard to the submissions of parties, t he Commission notes the submissions of \\nthe DG that JSW Paints added 1591 dealers over 2019 –20 and 2020 –21 vis-à-vis Asian \\nPaints, which added only 1217 new dealers during the same period. The Commission \\nalso notes that, out of 1591 dealers of JSW Paints as on 31.03.2021, 1378(86.6%) dealers \\ndealt with Asian Paints  also. This figure of common dealers clearly demonstrate s that \\nJSW Paints’ entry into the market has not been impeded as claimed by it, and JSW Paints \\nhas made considerable inroads into the dealer network in a short span of time . With \\nregard to the allegations of emails sent by dealers to the DG regarding alleged anti -\\ncompetitive c onduct, the DG , as per records , gave ample opportunity to parties/third \\nparties to make their submissions, even till the time of finalisation of report. Also, as per \\nrecords, many of the complainants later during the course of investigation stated that \\nthere is no coercion exercised on part of Asian Paints. This was also stated by them on \\nsworn affidavits. In view of the foregoing, the Commission agrees with the DG that the \\nallegation in relation to denial of market access to distribution network to JSW Paints \\nunder Section 4(2)(c) of the Act is not substantiated in the facts and circumstances of the \\npresent case through credible evidence. \\n \\n57. With respect to the allegation pertaining to denial of access to infrastructural faci lities, \\nthe DG found that, even though Mrs. Kalebudde stated that she had not leased any of her \\nproperties to any paints company, JSW Paints has been able to corroborate from Bhoomi \\nrecords that warehouse leased to Asian Paints is owned by members of Kaleb udde’s \\nfamily. The DG has observed that Mrs. Kalebudde has not disclosed correct facts , and \\nthe incorrect facts could be due to pressure of Asian Paints. However, there is no \\nevidence on record to prove that the lease agreement entered into between by her with \\nJSW paints was terminated at the behest of Asian Paints , as was alleged by the \\nInformant.  \\n \\n58. The Commission observes that Mrs. Kalebudde, based on the DG’s finding , does not \\nappear to have given correct information, which raises doubt s as to her response \\nfurnished to the DG . However, the email dated 15.05.2019, written by Mr. Thanvi of \\nJSW Paints to Srivastan of Kalebudde  Logistics, highlights that the contract was \\nmutually terminated. It has also been stated in the said email that the alternate o ptions \\nprovided by Kalebudde Logistics were not suitable for the operations of JSW Paints. In a'),\n",

Upon perusal of the said emails, the \\nCommission observes that initially , when the commercial contract for leasing of \\nwarehouse was breached, JSW  Paints “respected their decision of not going ahead with  \\nthe leasing of the property ” and just sought a refund of the security deposit. In fact, as \\nper the evidence on record , it appears that the reason for termination of the said lease \\nagreement seems to be a dispute regarding extension of CFA and logistics se rvices \\nbetween the two parties to the agreement. Therefore, the Commission is of the view that \\nthere appears to have existed some  interse disputes between JSW Paints and Mrs. \\nKalebudde, which cannot be attributable to Asian Paints in the absence of any con crete \\nevidence. Thus,  the allegation of denial of infrastructural facilities is not supported by \\nevidence on record. Accordingly, the Commission is of the view that no case of \\ncontravention of provisions of Section 4 of the Act is made out in the facts of the present \\ncase due to lack of evidence on abusive conduct of Asian Paints.  \\n \\nIssue 2: Whether Asian Paints is liable for contravention of provisions of Section 3(4) \\nof the Act.  \\n \\n59. The next issue that arises for consideration of the Commission is whether the restraints \\nimposed by Asian Paints upon the dealers to not deal with JSW Paints when they are \\ndealing with Asian Paints are in the nature of exclusive supply agreement and refusal to \\ndeal and amount s to contravention of provisions of Section  3(4)(b) and 3(4)(d) of the \\nAct. In order to substantiate the allegations raised by JSW Paints against Asian Paints in \\nthis regard, the responses of JSW Paints, Asian Paints and certain dealers who dealt with \\nboth Asian Paints and JSW Paints were sought by the DG. Upon scrutiny of the replies \\nof thirty party dealers who came forward before the DG, the DG observed that a majority \\nof the dealers claimed that supplies from Asian Paints were unstable and eventually \\nstopped after they took dealership of JSW Paints/other manufacturer. It was also \\nmentioned that the credit limit was also reduced without any prior intimation. On \\naccount of the fall in supplies and reduction in credit limits, dealers ’ sales of products of \\nAsian Paints decreased , which denied them of different incentives, schemes and other \\nbenefits. It was also submitted that dealers were forced to purchase the products of Asian'),\n",

Certain dealers also claimed th at \\ntheir access to the My Awaaz app was also blocked. Due to blocked access, some dealers \\nwere unable to substantiate their claims of stoppage of supplies  and non-service of \\norders. As per the DG, the allegations prima facie appeared to be substantiated by their \\nreplies. It was also noticed that two dealers, Amutha Hardware and Kumaraan Hardware, \\nclaimed that supplies from Asian Paints were unstable from the time they had obtained \\ndealership of Nippon Paints in July 2018. Giv en their past experience, they had not \\nfocused on the sale of products of JSW Paints despite opting for its dealership. The \\ndealers had also submitted that representative s of Asian Paints came to know of the fact \\nthat a given dealer decided to go for  a dealership of products of JSW Paints from the \\npresence of the JSW Paints tinting machine at the dealer’s premises. These \\nrepresentatives further threatened dealers with actions such as strict enforcement and \\nreduction in credit limit  and stoppage of supplies unless the dealer stops doing business \\nwith JSW Paints and returns JSW Paints materials along with its display materials and \\ntinting machines back.  \\n \\n60.

However, the allegations raised by the dealers lost their sheen \\nwhen read with specific responses from Asian Paints submitted before the DG.  \\n \\n61. With respect to the allegation in respect of reduction of credit limit of the dealers, the DG \\nfound that a ll the allegations made by the dealers appear ed to be \\nmisconceived/motivated, as Asian Paints was able to adduce substantive evidence to \\nprove that the act of reduction in credit of a dealer was not due to the alleged business \\nassociation of a dealer with a competitor but its own mutual business relationship. The \\nreduction in credit limit in most of the cases was necessitated either due to reduction in \\nofftake of the dealer concerned or unpaid accumulated dues over a period of time. The'),\n",

Asian Paints ’ conduct did not show any abnormal trends in terms of \\norders serviced for any specific dealer during the period o f thirteen months (6 months \\nbefore and after start of the dealers ’ business with JSW Paints) . The DG observed that \\nAsian Paints substantiated its contentions by adducing evidence in the form of detail s of \\ncertain dealers in the relevant geographies, whose credit limit was increased/decreased as \\na matter of routine, dependent purely on the performance of the concerned dealer.  The \\nCommission thus notes that it cannot be said merely because of drop -in servicing the \\norders by Asian Paints, the same can be attributed to relationship of a particular dealer \\nwith JSW Paints.  \\n \\n63. As regards the alle gations of attempts by Asian Paints to pressurise the dealers to return \\nJSW Paints tinting machine, the DG could not unearth credible evidence from any dealer \\nthat could corroborate the allegation against Asian Paints. Accordingly, the DG observed \\nthat the restraints in the nature of exclusive supply agreement and refusal to deal under \\nSection 3(4)(b) and 3(4)(d) of the Act could not be substantiated with concrete evidence. \\n \\n64. In this regard, the Commission notes that Asian Paints has stated that it has not entered \\ninto any anti -competitive agreement with dealers or hindered them from conducting \\nbusiness with any other pain t company of their choice. It has been stated that reduction \\nin credit limits was justified and based on objective criteria , and the DG has made \\nfleeting observations regarding Sivasankara Agencies, Sagar Hardware and Paints, Sri \\nNaga Sai Maruthi Agencies and Naga Traders. With respect to Siva Sankara Agencies, \\nSagar Paints and Nayak Traders, it has been clarified that the DG’s investigation found'),\n",

It has been stated that Asian Paints should have commercial freedom to determine \\nits commercial decisions , and the Commission should not spend its valuable time and \\nresources on ascertaining the commercial aspects of Asian Paints business. The practice \\nof Asian Paints with respect to supply and servicing of orders have been justified. Asian \\nPaints did not pressurise or influence any dealer to remove the JSW signag e, material or \\ntinting machines. Asian Paints has further submitted that the fleeting observations \\nregarding the R etail Value Maximiser (RVM)  programme should not be read as \\nconclusive finding s on anti -competitive conduct. In any case, the RVM programme is  \\nobjectively justified and does not cause any appreciable adverse effect in the relevant \\nmarket. Asian Paints has reiterated that its dealings with all the dealers have been \\nreasonable and based on objective criteria. Further, according to investigation, the \\nevidence provided by the dealers and JSW Paints appeared to be misleading and created \\nat the behest of JSW Paints. It has been stated that after nearly 1.5 years of investigation, \\nJSW Paints filed a letter dated 21.08.2021, which was purportedly written  by one Ram \\nKumar Mistry (Proprietor of Neelam Hardware, Thane West, Mumbai. As per Asian \\nPaints, JSW Paints had obtained this letter from the dealer without providing the dealer \\nwith the true context. It has deployed this tactic with a means to manipulate  the dealer \\ninto assuming that the letter is a requirement for JSW Paints’ audit team but the company \\ninstead used the letter in the ongoing investigation by submitting it to the DG, without \\nany consent from the dealer or even informing the dealer  that it is doing so . On \\n25.11.2021, the dealer wrote to the DG dismissing the allegations against Asian Paints \\nand shared the same with Asian Paints setting out the context why the letter dated \\n21.08.2021 was written. Thereafter, Asian Paints had submitte d a voluntary affidavit \\nfrom the said dealer stating that the said dealer was coerced and manipulated to issue the \\nletter dated 21.08.2021. \\n \\n65. JSW Paints, while disagreeing with the DG analysis of Asian Paints’ conduct, stated that \\nthe analysis by the DG under Section 3(4) of the Act is incomplete , as there is a failure \\non the part of the DG to analyse the conduct of the dealers who were coerced by Asian \\nPaints not to deal with JSW Paints.  It has been stated that the DG Report has carried out \\nan investigation in relation to only 15 dealers, most of whom did not succumb to the'),\n",

As per JSW Paints, t he \\nfocus of investigation should have been upon dealers who succumbed to the pressure of \\nAsian Paints  and stopped dealing with JSW Paints. The DG has failed to take into \\naccount the detailed evidence submitted by JSW Paints regarding the dealers who fell \\nprey to the pressure exerted by Asian Paints and stopped dealing with JSW Paints. Many \\nsuch dealers had to stop dealing with JSW Paints despite depositing initial confirmation \\ncheques. JSW Paints ha d submitted a list of 107 dealers who invested in JSW Paints \\ntinting machines but had to completely stop dealing with the company. JSW Paints also \\nsubmitted a l ist of 13 dealers who purchased the JSW Paints tinting machines but were \\nnot able to use them. JSW Paints had also submitted detailed reasons as to why these \\ndealers did not install the tinting machine.  JSW Paints has stated that t he fact that such a \\nlarger number of dealers refused to even come forward to call out Asian Paints ’ abusive \\npractices itself demonstrates the fear of a giant like Asian Paints among dealers , as paint \\ndealers are small ‘mom and pop’ stores and any coercive action by Asian Pain ts \\nimpinges on the daily livelihood of such dealers.  JSW Paints had also explained to the \\nDG that most of the dealers are scared of Asian Paints and are afraid of coming forward \\nagainst Asian Paints, as any coercive action by Asian Paints would result in losses which \\nsuch dealers cannot bear. Instead of taking such dealers into confidence, the DG decided \\nto not even attempt to investigate these dealers and simply relied on Asian Paints ’ \\nsubmissions on how it decided on credit reductions and supply stoppages. \\n \\n66. JSW Paints further stated that the analysis of the DG ’s finding  with respect to the 15 \\ndealers is also erroneous and follows faulty line of i nvestigation. The DG has used Asian \\nPaints’ broad submissions about general factors considered while reducing credit \\nlimit/stopping supply to justify the specific submissions of the dealers , which established \\na clear nexus between Asian Paints ’ actions and dealers’ association with JSW Paints.  \\nJSW Paints has submitted that , even with respect to the  specific replies by Asian Paints \\nfor each of the fourteen dealers, the DG has failed to analyse that Asian Paints never took \\nsuch extreme actions against the dealer in the past when similar situations of \\noverdue/reduction in off -take arose. Such an analys is would have clearly demonstrated \\nthat the real reason behind Asian Paints taking such extreme action (credit/supply block) \\nwas the dealer’s association with JSW Paints in defiance of Asian Paints ’ directions. \\nJSW Paints has stated that Asian Paints provi ded approximately 7,600 instances of'),\n",

On the basis of this data, the DG conc luded that the credit limit changes \\nwere routine business decisions implemented in view of the dealers ’ reduced \\nbusiness/payment overdue with Asian Paints. To investigate the issue of disproportionate \\ncredit reductions as alleged by certain dealers, the DG  ought to have focused on the \\ninstances of total credit block (i.e., reduction of credit limit to Re. 1). The DG should \\nhave checked the number/percentage of credit block cases out of the 7,600 instances \\ncited by Asian Paints and the reasons behind such exceptional credit blocks. Such an \\ninvestigation would have demonstrated that credit block s were used by Asian Paints to \\ndiscipline/punish dealers who dealt with JSW Paints against Asian Paints ’ will. \\nHowever, the DG wrongly relied on instances of routine credit limits \\nreduction/variations to dismiss the allegations of dealers who suffered disproportionate \\ncredit reductions/credit blocks due to their association with JSW Paints.  The DG \\nconfirmed that the quantum of reduction in credit limit by Asian Paints with respect to \\natleast four dealers, namely , Siva Sankara, Nayak Traders, Naga Sai and Sagar P aints \\nand Hardware, was disproportionate. However, the DG failed to investigate the actual \\nreasons for such credit block s. The multiple instances of Asian Paints ’ coercive actions \\nand imposition of restrictions highlighted also amount s to the contravention of Section \\n3(4)(b) and Section 3(4)(d) of the Act. As per JSW Paints, t he restrictions imposed by \\nAsian Paints have caused appreciable adverse effect on competi tion in the relevant \\nmarket under Section 19(3) of the Act  as the business practices of Asian Paints have \\ncreated barriers for a new entrant . Asian Paints ’ actions are also aimed at driving the \\ncompetitors out of the market.  \\n \\n67. The Commission, in the facts and circumstances of the case and based on evidence on \\nrecord, notes that the investigation has returned a finding that the reduction in credit limit \\nin almost all cases of dealers would have been  necessitated on account of business \\nconsiderations, either due to reduction in off -take by the dealer concerned or on account \\nof unpaid accumulated overdues over a period , which is stated to be as per a laid down \\npolicy of Asian Paints.

Thus, the Commission , based on material available \\non record, notes that there is no concrete evidence of alleged restraints imposed by Asian \\nPaints over the dealers to find contravention of provisions of Section 3(4) of the Act. \\nAccordingly, no case of contravention of provisions of Section 3(4) read with Section \\n3(1) is made out in the facts and circumstances of the present case.  \\n \\n68. With regard to Case No. 17 of 2021, the Commission notes that the DG found that the \\ndowngrade of the dealer Sri Balaji Traders from Critical Retailer to Colour World by \\nAsian Paints is fully justified and this downgrade had no relationship with starting a \\nbusiness with the competing brand. The inference has been drawn on the basis that the \\nchange in retailing tier was affected on 28.04.2021 as against the alleged claim of \\nFebruary 2021 by the dealer. Further , the dealer was consistently reducing offtake from \\nAsian Paints, which reduced to less than half over a 10-month period, from October 2020 \\nto July2021. The retailing tier of the said dealer was restored in June 2021 along with \\nseven other dealers after a review exercise undertaken by Asian Paints on the basis of \\nsales, expected sales, customer outreach and other relevant factors. \\n \\n69. The Commission observes that , as per the DG, the retailing tier of the said dealer was \\nrestored in June 2021 along with seven other dealers after a review exercise undertaken \\nby Asian Paints on the basis of factors such as sales , expected sales, customer outreach \\nand other relevant factors. It has also been brought out by the DG that the restoration of \\ndealers’ status was done prior to the filing of information in Case No.17 of 2021 . The \\nCommission notes that, as per the DG, the retailing status of the said dealer was changed \\nfrom Ezy Critical Retailer (Ezy CR) to Critical Retailer in 2018–19, when the said dealer \\nhad not even started business with any other competing brand. In view of the findings of \\nthe DG, the Commission notes that the allegation raised by Balaji Traders that the \\nsudden revocation of the CR status without prior intimation was to punish him for \\ndealing with JSW Paints  is misplaced . Accordingly, i n the facts of this case, the \\nCommission tends to agree with the findings of the DG that no case of contravention of \\nprovisions of Section 4 or Section 3(4) read with Section 3(1) of the Act. \\n \\n70.

In the present case, upon weighing the evidence on record, the Commissio n is of \\nthe view that the balance is not tilted towards JSW Paints. Asian Paints has been able to \\ndemonstrate that some of its conduct or practices adopted qua the dealers was in \\nfurtherance of its terms of doing business with such dealers and not to keep JSW Paints \\naway from the market.

Before parting with the order, the Commission notes that JSW Paints had filed an \\napplication dated 28.03.2022, inter alia, seeking a d irection to  the DG to grant an \\nopportunity of depositions to the aggrieved dealer s, who requested to submit additional \\nevidence to the DG and consider such evidence without a preconceived notion;  to \\ndetermine the investigation period during which the key abuse was alleged by JSW \\nPaints; to ensure fair procedure in the supplementary investigation and complete the DG \\nRecord with all the evidence submitted by JSW Paints and the aggrieved dealers; to grant \\nJSW Paints /dealers an opportunity to cross -examine the officials of A sian Paints  who \\nwere deposed by the DG; to direct the DG to revise the report based on the material from \\nthe cross-examination; and to pass any other order as the Commission may deem fit in \\nthe facts and circumstances of this case.

INTRODUCTION \\nIn the intricate tapestry of India's legal and \\nbureaucratic landscape, stamp papers have long \\nbeen a crucial thread binding transactions, \\nagreements, and contracts. These seemingly \\nmundane pieces of paper bear significant legal \\nweight, serving as tangible evidence of the parties' \\nintentions and obligations in myriad transactions, \\nfrom property transfers to lease agreements and \\nbeyond. Yet, beneath their ostensibly simple veneer \\nlies a complex history and a vulnerability to \\nexploitation, as illustrated by the infamous TELGI \\nscam of 2003. \\nThe TELGI scam, named after its \\nmastermind Abdul Karim Telgi, stands as a stark \\ntestament to the depths of corruption that can \\ninfiltrate the most seemingly mundane aspects of \\ngovernance and commerce. Telgi, a man of modest \\nbeginnings, rose to infamy through a web of deceit \\nand forgery that shook the foundations of India's \\nstamp paper system. His audacious scheme, which \\ninvolved the fabrication and distribution of \\ncounterfeit stamp papers worth billions of rupees, \\nnot only exposed gaping loopholes in the regulatory \\nframework but also laid bare the complicity of \\ngovernment officials, law enforcement agencies, and \\nfinancial institutions. \\nTo understand the magnitude of the TELGI \\nscam and its ramifications, one must delve into the \\nintricate interplay between the stamp paper system, \\nregulatory oversight, and the forces of corruption \\nthat enabled Telgi to  perpetrate one of the largest \\nfinancial frauds in India's history. This introduction \\nserves as a gateway into the labyrinthine corridors \\nof the TELGI saga, offering insights into its genesis, \\nmodus operandi, impact, and enduring legacy. \\nStamp papers, as i nstruments of legal \\nvalidation, trace their origins back centuries, their \\nuse enshrined in colonial -era laws and regulations \\nthat endure to this day. These papers, typically \\nimprinted with official seals and denominations, \\nserve as proof of payment of the requisite stamp \\nduty, a form of taxation levied on certain legal \\ndocuments to lendthem legal validity and \\nenforceability. The stamp duty regime, governed by \\na patchwork of state -level legislations and \\nregulations, forms a crucial source of revenue for \\nstate governments, while also ensuring the sanctity \\nand integrity of contractual agreements. \\nHowever, the very features that render \\nstamp papers indispensable in legal transactions also \\nrender them vulnerable to exploitation. Their \\nphysical form, often lacking  sophisticated security \\nfeatures, renders them susceptible to forgery and \\ncounterfeiting. Moreover, the decentralized nature \\nof their issuance and distribution, delegated to a \\nnetwork of authorized vendors and government \\nagencies, introduces multiple point s of vulnerability \\nwhere corruption can take root. \\nAbdul Karim Telgi, a former small -time \\ncriminal turned master forger, recognized these \\nvulnerabilities and capitalized on them with chilling \\nefficiency. Born into a humble family in Khanapur, \\nKarnataka, Telgi's early life bore little indication of \\nthe audacious criminal enterprise he would later \\norchestrate. However, fueled by ambition and a keen \\neye for opportunity, Telgi ventured into the murky \\nworld of counterfeit currency and documents, \\nhoning his skills in forgery and deception. \\nThe turning point in Telgi's criminal career \\ncame with his foray into the world of stamp papers. \\nSensing the immense profit potential in \\ncounterfeiting these seemingly innocuous \\ndocuments, Telgi set about establishing a sprawlin g \\nnetwork of operatives, printing presses, and \\ndistribution channels across multiple states. His \\noperation, fueled by a blend of ingenuity, \\nruthlessness, and corruption, soon burgeoned into a \\nmulti-billion rupee empire, spanning the length and \\nbreadth of the country. \\nCentral to Telgi's modus operandi was the \\nreplication of authentic stamp papers with\"),\n",

Armed with his \\ncounterfeit arsen al, Telgi infiltrated the legal and \\ncommercial landscape with impunity, flooding the \\nmarket with forged stamp papers that bore the \\nsemblance of authenticity. \\n \\nYet, perhaps even more audacious than \\nTelgi's counterfeiting operation was his ability to \\nsubvert the very institutions tasked with upholding \\nthe integrity of the stamp paper system. Government \\nofficials, entrusted with the oversight and regulation \\nof stamp paper issuance, were complicit in Telgi's \\nenterprise, turning a blind eye to glaring \\nirregularities in exchange for illicit gains. Law \\nenforcement agencies, meanwhile, found themselves \\noutmaneuvered and outgunned by Telgi's \\nsophisticated network, their efforts to apprehend \\nhim stymied by corruption and bureaucratic inertia. \\nThe revelation of the TEL GI scam sent \\nshockwaves rippling through India's legal and \\nbureaucratic establishment, laying bare the extent of \\ninstitutional decay and moral erosion that had \\nfacilitated Telgi's reign of deception. The economic \\nramifications of the scam were staggering, with \\nestimates of losses running into billions of rupees, \\nnot to mention the erosion of public trust in the \\nefficacy and integrity of government institutions. \\nIn the aftermath of the TELGI scandal, a \\nflurry of investigations, arrests, and legal \\nproceedings ensued, laying bare the rot within \\nIndia's administrative apparatus while also \\nunderscoring the challenges inherent in combating \\nwhite-collar crime of such magnitude. The saga of \\nTelgi and his counterfeit empire served as a wake -\\nup call for policymakers, prompting calls for \\nsweeping reforms to fortify the stamp paper system \\nagainst future vulnerabilities. \\nYet, as the dust settled on the TELGI \\nscandal and the perpetrators faced the full force of \\nlegal accountability, lingering questions remained \\nabout the d eeper systemic flaws that had enabled \\nsuch a brazen fraud to flourish unchecked. What \\nstructural reforms were necessary to prevent a \\nrecurrence of similar scams in the future? How \\ncould regulatory oversight be strengthened to detect \\nand deter corruption within the stamp paper system? \\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, what lessons could \\nbe gleaned from the TELGI saga to inform broader \\nefforts to combat financial fraud and institutional \\ndecay? \\nAs we embark on a journey through the \\nlabyrinthine corridors of the T ELGI scam, these \\nquestions loom large, guiding our exploration of a \\nsaga that transcends mere criminality to expose the \\nfragility of trust in the institutions that underpin our \\nlegal and commercial landscape. In unraveling the \\nintricacies of the TELGI saga,  we confront not only \\nthe darkness of corruption but also the resilience of \\nthe human spirit in the pursuit of justice and \\naccountability. \\n \\nBACKGROUND OF STAMP PAPER  \\nStamp papers have long served as essential \\ninstruments in legal transactions, bearing witness to \\nagreements, contracts, and transactions of various \\nkinds. Rooted in a rich history dating back centuries, \\nstamp papers have evolved from humble beginnings \\nto b ecome integral components of modern legal \\nsystems, including that of India. This section delves \\ninto the historical origins of stamp papers, their legal \\nsignificance, and the regulatory framework \\ngoverning their issuance and use. \\n \\n Historical Origins \\nThe use of stamped documents as legal \\ninstruments can be traced back to ancient \\ncivilizations, where seals and imprints were used to \\nauthenticate agreements and transactions. However, \\nthe modern concept of stamp papers emerged during \\nthe colonial era, with the  British East India \\nCompany introducing stamp duties as a means of \\nrevenue generation and document authentication. \\nIn India, the first comprehensive legislation \\ngoverning stamp duties was enacted in 1862 with \\nthe introduction of the Indian Stamp Act. This \\nlandmark legislation provided the legal framework \\nfor the imposition of stamp duties on various \\ninstruments, including agreements, deeds, and \\npromissory notes. The Act also established the use \\nof stamped papers as a means of indicating payment \\nof the requi site duty, thereby conferring legal \\nvalidity on the documents to which they were \\naffixed. \\nOver the years, the Indian Stamp Act \\nunderwent several amendments and revisions to \\nkeep pace with changing economic and legal \\nlandscapes.

These state -level laws \\noperate in conjunction with the central legislation, \\nharmonizing the stamp duty regime across different \\njurisdictions while also accommodating loca l \\nvariations and preferences. \\nThe administration of stamp duties is \\nentrusted to designated government authorities, \\nincluding revenue departments, registrar offices, and \\nauthorized stamp vendors. These authorities are \\nresponsible for the issuance, distribu tion, and \\nverification of stamp papers, as well as the \\ncollection of stamp duty revenues. \\nKey provisions of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, \\nrelevant to the issuance and use of stamp papers \\ninclude: \\n\\uf0b7 Section 3: Imposition of stamp duty on \\nspecified instruments. \\n\\uf0b7 Section 4: Requirement of stamping and \\nauthentication of instruments. \\n\\uf0b7 Section 5: Consequences of non -payment or \\ninadequate payment of stamp duty. \\n\\uf0b7 Section 6: Mode of affixing and cancelling \\nstamp papers. \\n\\uf0b7 Section 8: Power of government to prescribe \\nrules and regulations. \\nAdditionally, state -specific stamp duty laws may \\ncontain provisions governing stamp paper \\ndenominations, security features, and penalties for \\nnon-compliance. \\n \\nII. OVERVIEW \\nThe TELGI scam of 2003 stands as one of \\nthe most notorious instances of fi nancial fraud in \\nIndia's history, unraveling a complex web of \\ndeception, corruption, and institutional failure. At its \\ncenter was Abdul Karim Telgi, a small -time \\ncriminal turned master forger, whose audacious \\nscheme to counterfeit stamp papers shook the \\nfoundations of India's legal and bureaucratic \\nlandscape. This section provides a comprehensive \\noverview of the TELGI scam, from its origins and \\nmodus operandi to its impact and aftermath. \\n \\nIMPORTANCE OF STAMP PAPERS IN \\nLEGAL TRANSACTIONS  \\nStamp papers hold a  pivotal role in the \\nrealm of legal transactions, serving as tangible \\nevidence of the parties' intentions and commitments \\nin various agreements, contracts, and instruments. \\nThis section delves into the significance of stamp \\npapers in legal transactions, ex ploring their role in \\nconferring validity and enforceability to documents, \\ntheir importance in revenue generation for the \\ngovernment, and the regulatory framework \\ngoverning their issuance and usage. \\n \\n Validity and Enforceability \\nStamp papers play a crucial role in \\nensuring the validity and enforceability of legal \\ndocuments by serving as evidence of payment of the \\nrequisite stamp duty. The affixation of a stamp \\npaper to an instrument signifies compliance with \\nstatutory requirements, thereby lending legal \\nvalidity and authenticity to the document. \\nUnder the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, certain \\ntypes of documents are required to be executed on \\nstamp paper of prescribed denominations, with the \\nappropriate stamp duty affixed thereto. Failure to \\ncomply with these requir ements may render the \\ndocument null and void or render it unenforceable in \\na court of law.\"),\n",

By affixing a stamp \\npaper to a document, the parties signify their \\nwillingness to abide by the terms and conditions \\ncontained therein, with non -compliance potentially \\nresulting in legal consequences. \\n \\nRevenue Generation \\nIn addition to their role  in conferring legal \\nvalidity, stamp papers serve as a significant source \\nof revenue for the government, contributing to the \\npublic exchequer through the imposition of stamp \\nduty. Stamp duty is a form of taxation levied on \\ncertain documents, instruments, a nd transactions, \\nwith rates varying depending on the nature and \\nvalue of the transaction. \\nThe revenue generated from stamp duty \\ncollections is utilized by the government to fund \\nvarious developmental and welfare initiatives, \\nincluding infrastructure projec ts, social welfare \\nprograms, and public services. As such, stamp \\npapers not only serve a legal function but also play a \\ncrucial role in fiscal policy and public finance. \\nThe Indian Stamp Act, 1899, provides the \\nlegal framework for the imposition and collec tion of \\nstamp duty, prescribing the types of instruments \\nsubject to duty, the rates applicable thereto, and the \\nprocedures for stamping and authentication. State \\ngovernments are empowered to levy and collect \\nstamp duty within their respective jurisdictions , with \\nrates and exemptions varying across different states. \\n \\nIII. CONCLUSION \\nIn conclusion, the examination of stamp \\nduty systems, particularly in the context of India and \\nglobally, underscores the multifaceted nature of \\nthese regulatory frameworks. Throughout this \\nexploration, several key themes have emerged, \\nshedding light on the complexities, challenges, and \\nopportunities inherent in stamp duty administration \\nand enforcement. \\nFirst and foremost, the significance of \\nstamp duty as a crucial source of revenue fo r \\ngovernments cannot be overstated. Stamp duty \\nserves as a vital component of public finance, \\ncontributing to government budgets and financing \\nessential public services and infrastructure. \\nHowever, the effectiveness of stamp duty systems \\ndepends not only o n revenue generation but also on \\ntheir ability to ensure fairness, transparency, and \\ncompliance. \\nThe historical evolution of stamp duty \\nsystems reveals the intricate interplay between \\neconomic, social, and legal factors shaping their \\ndevelopment. From their origins in medieval Europe \\nto their modern-day manifestations, stamp duty laws \\nhave evolved in response to changing economic \\nconditions, market dynamics, and regulatory \\nimperatives. Understanding this historical context \\nprovides valuable insights into th e underlying \\nprinciples and objectives of stamp duty regulation. \\nThe TELGI scam of 2003 in India serves as \\na poignant example of the challenges and \\nvulnerabilities inherent in stamp duty systems. This \\nlarge-scale counterfeiting operation exposed \\nweaknesses in stamp paper production, distribution, \\nand verification processes, highlighting the need for \\nrobust regulatory oversight and enforcement \\nmechanisms. The repercussions of such scams \\nextend beyond financial losses to erode public trust \\nin the integrity of stamp duty systems. \\nImportantly, stamp duty systems play a \\ncrucial role in facilitating legal transactions, \\nproperty transfers, and commercial activities. Stamp \\nduty serves as a mechanism for regulating \\ntransactions, formalizing agreements, and protecting  \\nthe rights of parties involved. However, the \\ncomplexity and diversity of stamp duty laws across \\njurisdictions pose challenges for businesses, \\ntaxpayers, and legal professionals navigating the \\nregulatory landscape. \\nThe importance of stamp duty in legal \\ntransactions underscores the need for comprehensive \\nlegislative frameworks governing its administration \\nand enforcement. In India, the Indian Stamp Act, \\n1899, and corresponding state-level stamp duty laws \\nprovide the legal basis for stamp duty regulation. \\nThese legislative frameworks define the scope of \\nstamp duty, prescribe applicable rates, and establish \\nprocedures for stamping, payment, and verification \\nof stamp documents.\")]"
